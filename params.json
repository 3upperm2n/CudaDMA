{"name":"Cudadma","tagline":"Emulating DMA Engines on GPUs for Performance and Portability","body":"The CudaDMA library is a collection of DMA objects that support efficient movement of data between off-chip global memory and on-chip shared memory in CUDA kernels.  CudaDMA objects support many different data transfer patterns including sequential, strided, gather, scatter, and halo patterns.  CudaDMA objects provide both productivity and performance improvements in CUDA code:\r\n\r\n  * CudaDMA objects incorporate optimizations designed to fully utilize the underlying hardware and maximize memory bandwidth performance\r\n  * CudaDMA objects improve programmability by decoupling the declaration of a data transfer from its implementation\r\n\r\nBy handling the data-movement challenges on GPUs, CudaDMA makes it easier both to write CUDA code and achieve high performance.\r\n\r\n## IMPORTANT NOTE \r\nCudaDMA will only be supported through the Kepler architecture.  NVIDIA is considering adopting CudaDMA as a supported CUDA library if there is sufficient interest.  Please contact us if you're interested in continuing to use CudaDMA in the future.\r\n\r\n## Contributors \r\n[Mike Bauer](http://cs.stanford.edu/~mebauer)\r\n\r\n[Henry Cook](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hcook/)\r\n\r\n[Brucek Khailany](http://research.nvidia.com/users/brucek-khailany)","google":"UA-20524102-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
